### Summary
This seems like a friendly community and a pretty easy project to contribue to. Easy because there is lots of open issues, and because pull requests are closed frequently. Also there isnt tons of people wanting to contribute (there have only been 66 pull requests and in the past 20 a lot were from 3-4 years ago). So with all that in mind this is a simple project to contribute to.
